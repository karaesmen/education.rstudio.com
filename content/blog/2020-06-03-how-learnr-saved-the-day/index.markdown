Instructors and learners alike have had to quickly adapt to virtual education due to the ongoing pandemic. The [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package has become a popular tool to ease that transition (see Allison Horst's great  [post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/)).

Before our lives was completely changed by the pandemic, however; I was fortunate enough to conduct a *real life* introductory R session with a group of **teenagers**. I was able to create the materials for this session, [Understanding Injury Data with R](https://suchestoncampbell-lab.shinyapps.io/SummerCamp2019/), with the learnr package and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/karaesmen/SummerCamp2019/tree/master/tutorial). Although in person examples of teaching may not be the most relevant topic under these circumstances, I thought that sharing my experience of teaching a younger audience using learnr could offer a unique perspective. 

## Some background

I was asked to teach an introductory R session as a part of the [Data Science for Women Summer Camp](https://tdai.osu.edu/summer-camp/) in July 2019. The free of cost camp was organized by the Translational Data Analytics Institute at The Ohio State University (OSU). Admission was available for young women entering grades 8, 9, or 10 attending local high schools in the metro city area.

At the time I was asked to instruct the session, I was still a PhD student at OSU and the co-organizer of R-Ladies Columbus (I am still today). Camp organizers had seen me present several introductory R sessions in local conferences and R-Ladies meetups, and thought I would be a great instructor for **the only hands on coding session** of the entire data science camp. 

Camp organizers asked me to:

1. Show doing data analytics with R   
2. Expect no statistics background from students   
3. Use a health related dataset  
4. Do all of this in 50 minutes

Let me assure you they didn't come to me because they were amazed by my well commented, squeaky clean code, or my vast R/statistics knowledge. They invited me because thought I was very enthusiastic and had a "great energy", which they believed was the missing ingredient for this session in the past. It turns out that hands-on-coding sessions weren't a favorite among students the year before.


## Wake up call

I happily accepted to instruct the R session, because I really enjoy teaching R, and thought this short 50 minute session would be easy to figure out and wouldn't require much work. 

Well, I was certainly being naive. While there are many example teaching materials for R, most is designed for adults or young adults (college students), and at the time I couldn't find any examples for  middle- or high-schoolers. Although I came across some amazing K-12 lesson plans to teach statistics on [statisticsteacher.org](https://www.statisticsteacher.org), these weren't suitable for the short 50 minutes that was allotted for my session. (The wonderful [Teacups, Giraffes, & Statistics](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html) project didn't exist back then, but today it would be another wonderful resource to teach R and statistics to a young audience.)

I was also worried about finding a "fun" health dataset, but talking about diabetes, cancer, or some other complex disease did not sound fun to me at all. Knowing about the unpopularity of the session in the previous year, I was starting to feel quite desperate. I believed my session was going to mirror the [bored to death classroom scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk3-Vb7CH-o) from the infamous Ferris Bueller's Day Off movie.

Luckily, I attended [Kenia Wiedemann's talk](https://www.user2019.fr/static/pres/t258353.pdf) at useR!2019. [Kenia](https://concord.org/about/staff/kenia-wiedemann/) is involved with a research project called [CodeR4MATH](https://concord.org/our-work/research-projects/computing-with-r/), which aims to integrate R programming in high school math classes. While her curriculum also included multiple sessions throughout the semester, she talked about the amazing learnr package and all the cool things you can do with it. We also got a chance to chat about teaching R to teenagers and here some of the important points I remember from our conversation:    
  
1. You have to minimize any unnecessary distraction. Using RStudio Cloud or RStudio IDE in this setting might not be the best choice, as there are too many things you need to clarify before getting to the actual point. This is why learnr is perfect for this setting, you can limit what they can see and do very easily, without making it too rigid or boring.

1. Most teenagers are quite self-involved, you have to find a dataset that they can relate to -- if you want to get even *some* of their attention.   

1. Do not be discouraged if a session doesn't go very well. Some days, they might not even feel like listening to you, just because of the way you dress up or the class they had before you.   

I have to admit, at this point I was genuinely terrified and still didn't know what talk about. But I knew the tool I had to use: learnr!

## And learnr saves the day!

### Easy setup 

Beyond its pedagogical advantages, learnr is also a clean and easy way to deal with installation or subscription issues that come with dozens of laptops operating on a Windows. In my case, university was providing all the laptops for the session and it was up to me to set them up. Since we had internet connection available during the session, I certainly did not want to install R locally and was planning on using RStudio Cloud. Great, but then you have to then setup separate RStudio Cloud accounts for each machine, which includes setting up different email accounts as well (which we actually did and ended up with dozens of Gmail accounts ðŸ˜±). 

Thanks to learnr and its [easy deployment with shinyapps.io](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/publishing.html#RStudio_Connect_and_shinyappsio) I was able to simply enter the link into the browser for each laptop before the session and they were all ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

### Interactive code chunks

I was also finally happy with my dataset. I decided to use the [neiss](https://github.com/hadley/neiss) package, which provides access to the last five years of data (2013-2017) from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. The dataset is a sample of all accidents reported to emergency rooms in the US. 

Since the session was quite short, my aim wasn't *teaching them how to code in R* but *let them get a feel of it*. I didn't shy away from putting somewhat complicated code chunks in front of them, and expected them to find and change the arguments correctly to get the answers they needed. 

During the session, students talked with their neighbors about physical accidents/injuries they had at home or at school. Then they were able to adjust (fill in) the code in the tutorial with the correct variables/terms to look at the most frequently injured body parts for the overall US population, and their gender and age group in the dataset. 

Here's an example exercise chunk:

### Hints

I was also able to [add hints or solutions](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/exercises.html#Hints_and_Solutions) to every exercise, so students didn't get lost and suffer in silence if my instructions weren't clear. I think the hints were helpful, because although I was in the same room and walking around, I assumed many would be too shy to ask a question.

### Quizzes

I believe adding quizzes throughout the whole session kept students less distracted and more engaged, as they were busy trying to find the answers.

### Make it less dry

While default learnr style wasn't very aesthetically appealing to me, I didn't have time to explore customization steps before the session. But it is possible to be creative by adding pictures and videos!

<img src="img_exp.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

And if you would like to go above and beyond, there are many ways to [customize it further](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/formats.html#Tutorial_Format). Allison Horst's [Exploring missing values in naniar](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/missingexplorer/) is a shining example of what next level customization can do!

##  Student feedback

Throughout the session I went through the tutorial on my laptop, which was shared on two large screens for students to see. I walked around regularly to see students' progress or answer questions. Students talked and laughed about their injuries; some shared their stories with the rest of the class. Overall, I thought the session had good participation, even though it was the first activity of the day (as some students complained about it in their feedback).

Naturally, I was very curious to hear what students had to say after the session. Organizers shared the survey data from first two years of the camp: in 2018 same hands-on-coding session was conducted with a pre-written, commented R script by a young professor, and it was conducted with a learnr tutorial by me in 2019. Of course, I had to compare the two sessions. Here are the results:

Unfortunately, my hands-on-coding activity wasn't as popular as other camp activities that involved going to the planetarium or flying drones. ðŸ˜‚ However, I was very happy to see the decrease in the dislikes compared to previous year! 

Students were also asked to describe their experience with one word, here's a word cloud with them:



<img src="wordcloud.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Again it was encouraging to see words like "fun", "exciting", and "wow" frequently. (I'm not exactly sure what "funkyfresh" means, but I believe "fresh" is a positive thing?

The whole camp is about encouraging students to select analytical fields in the future. I really hope no student was discouraged of coding because of me! ðŸ™ƒ I aimed to give them a glimpse of coding, showing that it requires some work but can also still be fun. ðŸŽˆ

## Final words

The learnr package provides a powerful framework that lets students easily interact with the code without begin overwhelmed with errors, warnings, package installations, and all other distractions. Even though learnr is mostly designed for on online self-learning setting in mind, it is highly useful for live sessions where there is limited time to introduce RStudio IDE, or for young audiences that can be easily confused and disengaged with the material. Creating content with learnr certainly takes a little more time and effort than a simple RMarkdown document. It also requires a shinyapp.io account (possibly a paid one for better performance). But in my experience, it was worth all this manageable trouble and saved me from boring students to death! ðŸ¦¸
